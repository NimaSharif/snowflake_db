# snowflake_db

This is a Python/Jupyter blue print that should be used to convert a snowflake query into a pandas data frame

note that we need to have the following libraries installed onto our machine:
  - Pandas
  - snowflake connector https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/python-connector.html
  - And an additional ODBC program
